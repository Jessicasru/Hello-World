    <h2> About me</h2>
    <p> My name is Jessica and I love working on creative projects and learning new things. When I was a teenager, I taught myself the basics of HTML to customize early social media sites like PP2G, which were all the rage back in the day in the Netherlands. Coding always intrigued me, but I never followed through because I didn't think it was an actual career option. Now, I'm diving back in just for fun! I'm building a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, playing around and learning as I go. Who knows what it'll become - it's mainly about having a good time and exploring the possibilities!</p>
